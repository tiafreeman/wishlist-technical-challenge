    title: "The Cancer Code",
    publisherSummary:
      "In The Cancer Code, Dr Jason Fung offers a revolutionary new understanding of this invasive, often fatal disease - what it is, how it manifests and why it is so challenging to treat. In this rousing narrative, Dr Fung identifies the medical community's many missteps in cancer research - in particular, its focus on genetics, or what he terms the 'seed' of cancer, at the expense of examining the 'soil,' or the conditions under which cancer flourishes. Dr Fung - whose groundbreaking work in the treatment of obesity and diabetes has won him international acclaim â€“ suggests that the primary disease pathway of cancer is caused by the dysregulation of insulin. In fact, obesity and type 2 diabetes significantly increase an individual's risk of cancer.",

    title: "The Metabolic Approach to Cancer",
    publisherSummary:
      "Since the beginning of the 20th century, cancer rates have increased exponentially - now affecting almost 50 percent of the American population. Conventional treatment continues to rely on chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation to attack cancer cells. Yet research has repeatedly shown that 95 percent of cancer cases are directly linked to diet and lifestyle. The Metabolic Approach to Cancer is the audiobook we have been waiting for - it offers an innovative, metabolic-focused nutrition protocol that actually works.",

    title: "Radical Remission",
    publisherSummary:
      "A groundbreaking and inspiring book that provides the nine keys that can lead to a spontaneous remission from cancer - even after conventional medicine has failed. Early in her career, Kelly Turner, PhD, a researcher, lecturer, and counselor in Integrative Oncology, was shocked to discover that no one was studying episodes of drag this-radical remission, when people recover against all odds without the help of conventional medicine, or after conventional medicine has failed. She was so fascinated by this kind of remission that she spent eight years travelling through 10 countries to learn what factors that people experiencing this phenomenon encountered.",

    author: "Sam Harris",
    title: "Waking Up",
    publisherSummary:
      'From best-selling author, neuroscientist, and "new atheist" Sam Harris, Waking Up is for the increasingly large numbers of people who follow no religion, but who suspect that Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Rumi, and the other saints and sages of history could not have all been epileptics, schizophrenics, or frauds. Throughout the book, Harris argues that there are important truths to be found in the experiences of such contemplatives - and, therefore, that there is more to understanding reality than science and secular culture generally allow.',
